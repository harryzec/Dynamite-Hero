The videos would be playing in the background, while the notes are coming at you in the style of guitar hero. 

Funcitonality and MVP 
- Determine if you hit the notes at the appropriate time 
- play the song and stop once you have missed a certain amount of notes
- play the video in the background
- select which song you want to play

Day 1: 
  - getting AWS set up with the video and song
  - splash page where you can select the song

Day 2: 
  - take this day to figure out vanilla javascript and how I can get notes moving at you on the screen
  - start aligning the notes to the song

Day 3: 
  - figure out points system and how the app knows whether or not you hit the note on time

This will be implemented with Javascript
